# Java_for_car_data_problem
The Car Shop company sells used cars. The company needs an application where car details such as manufacturer, model, year, mileage, engine size, grade/condition of car (see Table 2), and price are entered. Based on the entered data, the application should produce various reports.![Screen Shot 2023-03-11 at 1 49 43 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94352431/224467501-e7ca9222-30e7-43ed-b2bf-705e6af5e538.png)

Design and build an application that requires the user to input the car’s data via the 
console/command line and store it in an appropriate internal structure. 
● There  is  no  requirement  for  this  data  to  be  preserved  after  the  application  is 
closed.
● You will need to consider what the application outputs to the user to 
demonstrate the results of each task below. 
● You should provide the user with a means to close the program once operations 
are complete.
Your application should be able to perform the following tasks as given in Section II. 
(Scenario):


1. Take user input – car’s data, i.e. manufacturer, model, year, mileage, 
grade/condition of car (see Table 2), and price and store it in an appropriate 
data structure. Sample data is provided in Table 1.
      Store car grade (condition) in an appropriate data structure. Sample data is 
provided in Table 2.


2. Sort all cars’ data by model (in alphabetical order) and generate a report like 
the sample report given in Table 3.![Screen Shot 2023-03-11 at 1 50 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94352431/224467539-492221f1-a825-4af1-806a-545c7ba5443f.png)


3. Sort all cars’ data by price (from low to high) and generate a report like the 
sample report given in Table 4.

4. Search and identify the car with the lowest mileage as given in Table 5.
5. Search and identify the car with the lowest price as given in Table 6.

6.Search car by ID (take car ID from user) and generate a report. Sample application input and sample output are given in Table 7. Note: Your report 
should show car condition instead of grade.

7. Generate the sample report to calculate the volume of car stock based on each manufacturer, total number of vehicles, and stock price as given in Table 8.
